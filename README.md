## Learning Machine Learning with basics examples 

The goal is to understand concepts of machine learning and fast computing with C++. 
I don't use python libraries intentionally 

### 1st project : digits recognization

Idea : building different models in C++ in order to test and compare them 
Using MNIST data set 
1. 1 layer neural network with sigmoid
