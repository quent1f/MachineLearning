## Learning Machine Learning with basics examples 

The goal is to understand concepts of machine learning and fast computing with C++. 
I don't use python libraries intentionally 

### Requierements : 

- Eigen librairy (for matrix/vector manipulation)

### Digits recognization

Idea : building different models in C++ in order to test and compare them 
Using MNIST data set 

1. 1 layer neural network with sigmoid 

Functionnal : 

- 1 layer Neural Network with sigmoid

TO DO : 

- Optimize everything with Eigen
- Oriented Object Programming to choose activation function, layers...
- Visualise pattern given by neurons (pipe to python ?) 

Things I wanna try :

- 2 or 3 layers NN
- Using other activation functions (ReLU / sigmoid) and compare 
- Convolutional neural network
